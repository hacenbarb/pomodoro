> The Pomodoro technique is a simple time management method that breaks work into intervals (25 min), called "pomodoros," separated by short breaks (5 min). and after certain pomodoros (4) you can take a long break (20 min) and so on. This approach not only boosts productivity but also reduces burnout and improves focus.
